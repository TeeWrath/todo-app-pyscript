#ToDo List App
This is a simple ToDo list application created using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and PyScript. It allows users to input tasks, create a checkbox, and mark the task as done. Once the task is marked as done, it is disabled, and a line is drawn through it. An error message is displayed if the user attempts to add a task without inputting any text.
